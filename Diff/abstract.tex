Applications of key-value (KV-)storage often exhibit high \emph{spatial locality}, such as  
when many data items have identical composite key prefixes.  
This prevalent access pattern is underused by the ubiquitous LSM  design underlying 
high-throughput KV-stores today.

We present \sys, a general-purpose persistent KV-store optimized for spatially-local %write-intensive
workloads. 
\sys\ combines spatial data partitioning with LSM-like  batch I/O. 
%forgoes the temporal data organization of LSM trees and instead partitions data by key to exploit locality. 
It achieves high throughput, 
ensures consistency under multi-threaded access,   
%offers much faster in-memory access than existing KV-stores, 
and reduces write amplification. 

In experiments with real-world data from a large analytics platform,  \sys\  
%consistently 
outperforms the state-of-the-art. E.g., on a 256GB production dataset, 
\sys\ ingests data $4.4\times$ faster than RocksDB  %scans recently ingested data up to \inred{1.7x} faster, 
and reduces write amplification by nearly $4\times$. 
%\sys\ further outperforms existing solutions whenever the system has sufficient DRAM to hold most of the active working set. 
In traditional YCSB workloads lacking spatial locality, %with working sets that are larger than the available DRAM size, 
\sys\ is on par with RocksDB and significantly better than other open-source solutions we explored.
