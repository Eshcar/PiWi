Applications of key-value (KV-)storage often exhibit high \emph{spatial locality}, such as  
when data items with identical composite key prefixes are created or scanned together.  
This prevalent access pattern is underused by the ubiquitous LSM  design underlying 
high-throughput KV-stores today.

We present \sys, a general-purpose persistent KV-store optimized for spatially-local %write-intensive
workloads. 
\sys\ forgoes the temporal data organization of LSM trees and instead partitions data by key to exploit locality. 
Its novel design achieves high throughput, 
ensures consistency under multi-threaded access,   
%offers much faster in-memory access than existing KV-stores, 
and reduces write amplification. 

Experiments with real-world data from a large analytics platform show that \sys\  
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art. For example, on a 256GB production dataset, 
\sys\ ingests data 3.7x faster than RocksDB,  scans recently ingested data up to \inred{1.7x} faster, 
and reduces write amplification by nearly 4x. 
%\sys\ further outperforms existing solutions whenever the system has sufficient DRAM to hold most of the active working set. 
In traditional YCSB workloads, %with working sets that are larger than the available DRAM size, 
\sys\ is on par with RocksDB and significantly outperforms other open-source solutions we explored.
