Applications of key-value (KV-)storage often exhibit high \emph{spatial locality}, such as  
when data items with identical composite key prefixes are created or scanned together.  
This prevalent access pattern is underused by the ubiquitous LSM tree design underlying 
KV-stores today.

We present \sys, a general-purpose persistent KV-store optimized for spatially-local workloads. 
\sys\ forgoes the temporal data organization of LSM trees and instead partitions data by key to exploit locality. 
It does so via a novel design that ensures consistency under multi-threaded access and 
offers much faster in-memory access than existing KV-stores,
while also reducing write amplification. 

Experiments with real-world data from a large analytics platform show that \sys\  
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art. For example, on a 256GB analytics dataset, 
\sys\ ingests data 3.7x faster than RocksDB,  scans recently ingested data up to 27\% faster, 
and reduces write amplification by nearly 4x. 
\sys\ further outperforms existing solutions whenever 
the system has sufficient DRAM to hold most of the active working set. 
In traditional YCSB workloads with working sets that are larger than the available DRAM size, 
\sys\ is on par with RocksDBS and significantly outperforms other open-source solutions we tested.
