We presented \sys\/ -- a novel persistent KV-store optimized for workloads with high spatial locality, as prevalent in modern data-driven 
applications. \sys\/ provides strong (atomic) consistency guarantees for random updates, random lookups, and range queries. 
\sys\/ outperforms the state-of-the-art RocksDB LSM store  in the  majority of YCSB benchmarks, with both 
standard and spatially-local key distributions, in which it excels in particular. \sys\/ further reduces write amplification to near-optimal under write-intensive 
workloads. Finally, it provides near-instant recovery from failures.
%, in contrast to traditional data stores based on centralized write-ahead logs.
\sys\/ is presented as a conceptual prototype, which can be improved in multiple ways through ideas borrowed from other designs. 
%It can also benefit from new hardware trends, in particular, non-volatile memory technologies.
