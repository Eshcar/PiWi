Many applications of key-value (KV-)storage exhibit high \emph{spatial locality}
of access, for example, when data items with identical composite key prefixes are created or scanned together.  
This prevalent access pattern is underused by the ubiquitous LSM tree design underlying KV-stores today.

We present \sys, a general-purpose persistent KV-store optimized for spatially-local workloads. 
\sys\ forgoes the temporal data organization of LSM trees, and partitions data by key, both in memory and on disk. 
%
\sys's design also reduces write amplification and expedites in-memory operation.
Our experiments show that \sys\ consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art (by  \inred{1.25x to 3x})
(1)  in cases of high spatial locality; and (2) when the system has sufficient DRAM to hold most of the active working set. 
In traditional YCSB workloads with larger working sets than the available  DRAM, \sys\ is on par with 
today's leading storage solutions.
\sys\/ scales on multicore platforms and provides strong (atomic) guarantees for updates, lookups, and scans. 
%Finally, it provides consistent crash recovery semantics, with near-instant recovery time.
