Many applications of key-value (KV-)storage  are characterized by high \emph{spatial locality}
of access, e.g., data items with identical composite-key prefixes are created or scanned together.  
This prevalent access pattern is underused by the ubiquitous LSM-tree design employed by KV-stores today.

We present \sys, a persistent KV-store designed for spatially-local workloads, in particular through better use of RAM
that reduces disk I/O.  It outperforms RocksDB -- an industry-leading LSM database -- on workloads with spatial locality, e.g.,  range scan throughput
improves by 1.25x to 3x. \sys\/ further reduces write amplification 
by up to 2.6x, thereby contributing to slower device wear. \sys\/ scales on multicores platforms and provides strong (atomic) guarantees for updates, lookups, and scans. Finally, it provides consistent crash recovery semantics, with near-instant recovery time.
