Many applications of key-value (KV-)storage exhibit high \emph{spatial locality}
of access, for example, when data items with identical composite key prefixes are created and  scanned together.  
This prevalent access pattern is underused by the ubiquitous LSM tree design underlying KV-stores today.
%
We present \sys, a persistent KV-store targeting spatially-local workloads. \sys\ forgoes the temporal data organization 
of LSM trees, and partitions data by key, both in memory and on disk. 
In workloads with high locality, \sys\  consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art. 
For example, its range scan throughput in workloads with composite keys is \inred{1.25x to 3x} higher than that 
of RocksDB -- an industry-leading LSM database.  \sys\/ further reduces write amplification 
by up to \inred{2.6x}, thereby contributing to slower device wear. \sys\/ scales on multicore platforms and provides strong (atomic) guarantees for updates, lookups, and scans. 
%Finally, it provides consistent crash recovery semantics, with near-instant recovery time.
