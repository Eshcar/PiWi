Real-time applications of key-value (KV-)storage technologies are often characterized by high \emph{spatial locality}
of access -- e.g., data items with identical composite-key prefixes are frequently created or scanned together.  
This prevalent access pattern is underused by the LSM-tree design that rules data organization in modern KV-stores.
We present \sys, a persistent KV-store designed for spatially-local workloads, in particular through better use of RAM
that reduces disk I/O.  It exceeds the performance of RocksDB -- an industry-leading LSM database -- in the majority 
of standard YCSB benchmarks, especially under the workloads of interest. For example, \sys\/ outperforms RocksDB 
by 1.5x to 3x in range scan throughput. It reduces write amplification by up to 2.6x, thereby contributing to slower 
device wear. \sys\/ provides strong (atomic) theoretical guarantees for random updates, random lookups, and scans. 
Finally, it provides consistent crash recovery semantics, with near-instant recovery time.
