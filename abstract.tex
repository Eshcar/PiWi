Many applications of key-value (KV-)storage technologies are characterized by high \emph{spatial locality}
of access, e.g., data items with identical composite-key prefixes are created or scanned together.  
This prevalent access pattern is underused by the ubiquitous LSM-tree employed KV-stores today.
We present \sys, a persistent KV-store designed for spatially-local workloads, in particular through better use of RAM
that reduces disk I/O.  It outperforms RocksDB -- an industry-leading LSM database -- in the majority 
of standard YCSB benchmarks, and more notably on workloads with spatial locality. For example, \sys\/ 
exceeds RocksDB by 1.5x to 3x in range scan throughput in these scenarios. It further reduces write amplification 
by up to 2.6x, thereby contributing to slower device wear. \sys\/ provides strong (atomic) guarantees for random updates, 
random lookups, and scans. Finally, it provides consistent crash recovery semantics, with near-instant recovery time.
