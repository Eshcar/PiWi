We presented \sys\/ -- a novel persistent KV-store designed for workloads of high spatial locality that are prevalent in modern data-driven 
applications. \sys\/ provides strong (atomic) consistency guarantees for random updates, random lookups, and range queries. 
\sys\/ exceeds the state-of-the-art RocksDB LSM storage performance in the vast majority of YCSB benchmarks applied to both 
standard and spatially-local workloads, in which it excels in particular. \sys\/ reduces write amplification to near-optimal under write-intensive 
workloads. Finally, it provides near-instant recovery from failures, contrast to traditional data stores based on centralized write-ahead logs.

\sys\/ is presented as a conceptual prototype, which can be improved in multiple ways through ideas borrowed from LSM systems. 
It can also benefit from new hardware trends, in particular, non-volatile memory technologies.
